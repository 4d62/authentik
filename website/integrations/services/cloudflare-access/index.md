<span class="badge badge--secondary">Support level: Community</span>

## What is Cloudflare Access

> Cloudflare Access is a secure, cloud-based zero-trust solution for managing and authenticating user access to internal applications and resources.

## Preparation

The following placeholders are used in this guide:

- `company.cloudflareaccess.com` is the FQDN of your Cloudflare Access subdomain.
- `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik installation.

To proceed, you need to register for a free Cloudflare Access account and have both a Cloudflare account and a publicly accessible authentik instance with a trusted SSL certificate.

:::note
This documentation lists only the settings that you need to change from their default values. Be aware that any changes other than those explicitly mentioned in this guide could cause issues accessing your application.

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Cloudflare Access with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

**Create an application and provider in authentik**

In the authentik Admin Interface, navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **[Create with Provider](/docs/add-secure-apps/applications/manage_apps#add-new-applications)** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can create only an application, without a provider, by clicking **Create**.)

- **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
- **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
    - Note the **Client ID**,**Client Secret**, and **slug** values because they will be required later.
    - Set a `Strict` redirect URI to <kbd>https://<em>company</em>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback/</kbd>.
    - Select any available signing key.
- **Configure Bindings** _(optional):_ you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a userâ€™s **My applications** page.

## Cloudflare Access configuration

1. Open the [Cloudflare Access dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com) and navigate to **Settings** -> **Authentication**.
2. Click **Login methods**, and then select **Add** -> **OpenID Connect**.
3. From the authentik provider you created earlier, copy the following details and paste them into the corresponding fields:
    - **Client ID** -> App ID
    - **Client Secret** -> Client Secret
    - **Authorize URL** -> Auth URL
    - **Token URL** -> Token URL
    - **JWKS URL** -> Certificate URL
4. Click **Save**.
5. Click **Test** to verify the login provider.

## Configuration verification

To confirm that authentik is properly configured with Cloudflare Access, click the **Test** button found right next-to the **Save** button from the previous step.
