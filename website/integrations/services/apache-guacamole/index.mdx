# Integrate with Apache Guacamole™

<span class="badge badge--primary">Support level: authentik</span>

## What is Apache Guacamole™

> Apache Guacamole is a clientless remote desktop gateway. It supports standard protocols like VNC, RDP, and SSH.

## Preparation

The following placeholders are used in this guide:

- `guacamole.company` is the FQDN of the Guacamole installation.
- `authentik.company` is the FQDN of the authentik installation.

:::note
This documentation lists only the settings that you need to change from their default values. Be aware that any changes other than those explicitly mentioned in this guide could cause issues accessing your application.
:::

## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Apache Guacamole with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

**Create an application and provider in authentik**

In the authentik Admin Interface, navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **[Create with Provider](/docs/add-secure-apps/applications/manage_apps#add-new-applications)** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can create only an application, without a provider, by clicking **Create**.)

- **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
- **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
- **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
    - Note the **Client ID**,**Client Secret**, and **slug** values because they will be required later.
    - Set a `Strict` redirect URI to <kbd>https://<em>guacamole.company</em>/</kbd>. If you have configured [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) to run Apache Guacamole on a subpath, you will need to update this value accordingly.
    - Select any available signing key.
- **Configure Bindings** _(optional):_ you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user’s **My applications** page.

## Apache Guacamole Configuration

It is recommended to create an admin account in Guacamole before configuring Single Sign-On to simplify the process. Create a user in Guacamole using the same username as in authentik and grant them admin permissions. This step is important to avoid losing access to the Guacamole admin settings, as you may need to revert your changes without it.

:::warning
You can configure Apache Guacamole to use either the `sub` or `preferred_username` as the UID field under `user-name-attribute`. When using `preferred_username` as the user identifier, ensure that the [**Allow users to change username** setting](https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/sys-mgmt/settings#allow-users-to-change-username) is disabled to prevent authentication issues. The `sub` option uses a unique, stable identifier for the user, while `preferred_username` uses the username configured in authentik.

Docker containers are typically configured using environment variables. To ensure proper integration, add the following variables to your `.env` file:

<IntegrationsMultilineCodeblock>
    {`
OPENID_AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT=https://<em>authentik.company</em>/application/o/authorize/
OPENID_CLIENT_ID=<em>Client ID from authentik</em>
OPENID_ISSUER=https://<em>authentik.company</em>/application/o/<em>your-slug</em>/
OPENID_JWKS_ENDPOINT=https://<em>authentik.company</em>/application/o/<em>your-slug</em>/jwks/
OPENID_REDIRECT_URI=https://<em>guacamole.company</em>/ # Must match Redirect URI in authentik
OPENID_USERNAME_CLAIM_TYPE=preferred_username
`}
</IntegrationsMultilineCodeblock>

Additionally, ensure your `guacamole.properties` file (typically located in `/etc/guacamole/`) includes the following line. This setting allows environment variables to be evaluated before static configuration files:

<IntegrationsMultilineCodeblock>
    {`
enable-environment-properties: true
`}
</IntegrationsMultilineCodeblock>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="standalone">
    To set up Apache Guacamole in a standalone environment, you'll need to adjust the settings in the `guacamole.properties` file, usually found in the `/etc/guacamole/` directory. Add the following settings:

<IntegrationsMultilineCodeblock>
    {`
openid-authorization-endpoint=https://<em>authentik.company</em>/application/o/authorize/
openid-client-id=<em>Client ID from authentik</em>
openid-issuer=https://<em>authentik.company</em>/application/o/<em>your-slug</em>/
openid-jwks-endpoint=https://<em>authentik.company</em>/application/o/<em>your-slug</em>/jwks/
openid-redirect-uri=https://<em>guacamole.company</em>/ # This must match the Redirect URI set in authentik (Including trailing slash).
openid-username-claim-type=preferred_username
`}
</IntegrationsMultilineCodeblock>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configuration verification

To verify that authentik is correctly configured with Apache Guacamole, log out and log back in through authentik. You should notice a new button appearing at the bottom left of the login page.
